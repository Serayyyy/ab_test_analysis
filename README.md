# A/B Testing Project

This project aims to implement A/B testing to evaluate an alternative design for the subscription screen in our mobile application. After user onboarding, users are presented with a weekly subscription offer of $4.99. Currently, 17% of users who see this offer purchase a subscription.

## Project Goals

1. **Hypothesis Development**: We expect the alternative design to increase the subscription purchase rate.
2. **Audience Definition**: Users who download the app and reach the subscription screen will be included in the test.
3. **Metric Selection**: 
   - Target Metric: Subscription purchase rate
   - Auxiliary Metric: Number of users viewing the screen

## Hypothesis

Stating that the new design offers a 50% discount will increase the subscription purchase rate.

## User Audience Definition

- Approximately 2,000 users download the app daily.
- 34% of these users reach the subscription screen.
- Number of users participating in the test: `2,000 * 0.34 = 680 users`.

## Metric Selection

- **Target Metric**: Subscription purchase rate; this will indicate the main success of the test.
- **Auxiliary Metric**: Number of users viewing the screen; this will measure user engagement and screen visibility.

## Sample Size Calculation

1. Current subscription purchase rate: 17%
2. We aim to increase this to 25% with the alternative design.
3. Sample size should be calculated through power analysis. (Calculations can be detailed further.)

## Test Duration

The test should typically run for 2-4 weeks to achieve statistically significant results.

## Success Criteria

The test will be considered successful if:
- The target metric shows an increase to 25%.
- A noticeable increase is observed in the auxiliary metric (viewing numbers).

## Alternative Test Suggestion

If the test is unsuccessful, we can conduct another design test that provides users with more information through an informative screen.
